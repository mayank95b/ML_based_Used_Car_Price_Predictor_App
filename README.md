# Used_Car_Price_Predictor_App

The objective of the project is to build a Web App to predict the selling price of the used car by using Machine Learning model.

## Description

Implemented linear regression and scikit-learn to make an optimal model for predicting selling prices of used car using the Vehicle dataset from cardekho available at kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho

This dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com

This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.
The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

    name
    year
    selling_price
    km_driven
    fuel
    seller_type
    transmission
    Owner
